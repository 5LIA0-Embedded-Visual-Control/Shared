# BRAIN

We will implement a ROS node named "brain" to assemble multiple functions, such as finding duckies or house, going towards the house, obstacle avoidance.

## How to Use It

### 0. Do you get the physical Duckiebot ?

Please say yes.

If not, go and buy one. 

### 1. git clone this repository to a folder

Basic operation

### 2. type two commands in terminal

Open a terminal in the folder saving all these files

Type "dts devel build -f -H db1.local" at first -- build an image 

And then, type "dts devel run -H db1.local"  -- run the image

### 3. just wait

you can observe the state of duckiebot by looking at lines shown in terminal.

Loading yolov5 model will take some time, be patient
